<P>Writers write descriptive paragraphs because their purpose is to describe something. Their point is that something is beautiful or 
disgusting or strangely intriguing<sup>0</sup>. Writers write persuasive and argument paragraphs because their purpose is to persuade or 
convince someone<sub> 1</sub>. Their point is that their reader should see things a particular way and possibly take action on that new way of 
seeing things.</P>

<P>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least 
five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes 
a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116)
. Length and 
appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic 
styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In 
this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph. </P>
